## 9. Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your radio is powered on and within Bluetooth range of your iPhone.
- If the app loses connection, it will attempt to reconnect automatically.
- If you cannot pair, try "forgetting" the device in the app and in the iOS Bluetooth settings.

### Message Delivery Failures

- Mesh networking depends on line-of-sight and signal strength.
- If a message fails, try moving to a higher location or closer to a repeater.
- You can tap the **Retry** button on a failed message to resend using flood mode.

### Sync Issues

- If contacts or channels seem out of date, pull down on the list to refresh.
- The app shows a "Syncing..." indicator when synchronizing with your radio.

### Battery Drain

- Reduce transmit power if you don't need maximum range.
- Disable location sharing if you don't need others to see your position.
- The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy, which is designed for efficiency.
