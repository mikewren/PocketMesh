# Translations

PocketMesh supports multiple languages. You can help improve translations entirely through GitHub's website — no coding tools or experience required.

## Supported Languages

| Language              | Code    | Status             |
|-----------------------|---------|--------------------|
| English               | en      | Complete (source)  |
| German                | de      | AI-translated      |
| Dutch                 | nl      | AI-translated      |
| Polish                | pl      | AI-translated      |
| Russian               | ru      | AI-translated      |
| Ukrainian             | uk      | AI-translated      |
| Spanish               | es      | AI-translated      |
| French                | fr      | AI-translated      |
| Simplified Chinese    | zh-Hans | AI-translated      |

Languages marked "AI-translated" were generated using AI and may contain errors. Native speaker verification is welcome.

## Quick Reference

Translation files use a simple format:

```
/* Description of what this text is for */
"settings.title" = "Settings";
```

- **Left side** (`"settings.title"`) — the key. Don't change this.
- **Right side** (`"Settings"`) — the translation. This is what you edit.
- **`%@`** — a placeholder for text (e.g., a name). Keep it in your translation.
- **`%d`** — a placeholder for a number. Keep it in your translation.
- **Comments** (`/* ... */`) — context to help you translate. Don't edit these.

## How to Improve Existing Translations

You can fix a translation directly on GitHub — no tools needed.

1. Go to the [Localization folder](https://github.com/Avi0n/PocketMesh/tree/dev/PocketMesh/Resources/Localization) and open your language's folder (e.g., `de.lproj` for German).
2. Click the `.strings` file you want to edit (e.g., `Settings.strings`).
3. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) near the top-right of the file.
4. GitHub will ask you to **fork the repository** — click **"Fork this repository"**. This creates your own copy so you can make changes.
5. The editor opens. Find the line you want to fix and change the text on the **right side** of the `=` sign.
6. Click **"Commit changes…"**, then click **"Propose changes"**.

**If you want to edit more files** before submitting, don't create the pull request yet. Instead, go to your fork (GitHub shows a link to it at the top of the page). Find the branch it created (e.g., `patch-1`), navigate to the next file you want to edit, and repeat steps 5–6. Each edit adds another commit to the same branch.

**When you're done with all your edits**, go to the "Comparing changes" page (GitHub shows this after each commit, or you can find it on your fork under "Contribute" → "Open pull request"). Use the **base** dropdown to select **`dev`** as the target branch, then click **Create pull request**.

**Example:** Fixing a German translation in `de.lproj/Settings.strings`:

```
/* Before */
"settings.title" = "Einstellungen";

/* After — your improved translation */
"settings.title" = "Konfiguration";
```

## How to Add Missing Translations

If you see English text while using PocketMesh in another language, a translation is missing. Here's how to add it:

1. First, find the English text. Go to `PocketMesh/Resources/Localization/en.lproj/` and search through the `.strings` files until you find the line with that English text.
2. Note the **key** (the left side of the `=` sign) and which **file** it's in.
3. Go to the same file in your language's folder (e.g., `de.lproj/`).
4. Click the **pencil icon** to edit, then click **"Fork this repository"** when prompted.
5. Add a new line with the key and your translation:
   ```
   "the.key.you.found" = "Your translation here";
   ```
6. Click **"Commit changes…"**, then click **"Propose changes"**.
7. To add more missing translations, navigate to the next file on your fork's branch and repeat steps 5–6.
8. When you're done, go to the "Comparing changes" page, use the **base** dropdown to select **`dev`**, then click **Create pull request**.

## How to Request a New Language

Open an [issue](https://github.com/nicklama/PocketMesh/issues) and include:

- The language name and code (e.g., "Japanese — ja")
- Whether you'd be willing to help review translations

We can generate AI translations for new languages, but native speaker review makes a big difference.

## File Structure

Translation files are organized by feature under `PocketMesh/Resources/Localization/`:

```
Localization/
  en.lproj/           # English (source language)
    Localizable.strings       # Common strings (buttons, tabs, errors)
    Localizable.stringsdict   # Pluralization rules for common strings
    Chats.strings             # Chat feature
    Chats.stringsdict         # Pluralization for chat feature
    Contacts.strings          # Contacts and nodes
    Map.strings               # Map feature
    Onboarding.strings        # Onboarding flow
    Settings.strings          # Settings screens
    Tools.strings             # Tools feature
    RemoteNodes.strings       # Remote nodes feature
  de.lproj/           # German
  nl.lproj/           # Dutch
  ...                 # Other languages
```

## For Developers

The sections below are for code contributors adding new strings or working with pluralization. If you're only translating, you can stop here.

### Adding New Strings

#### Step 1: Add to English .strings File

Add your string to the appropriate feature file in `en.lproj/`:

```
/* Location: MyView.swift - Purpose: Button to submit form */
"myFeature.submitButton" = "Submit";
```

Include a comment with file location and purpose.

#### Step 2: Use the Generated Constant

SwiftGen generates type-safe constants. After building, use:

```swift
// For Localizable.strings
L10n.Localizable.Common.ok

// For feature-specific files
L10n.Chats.Conversation.sendButton
L10n.Settings.Account.title
```

#### Step 3: Add Translations

Add the same key to all other language files. You can use AI translation as a starting point, but mark it for review:

```
/* Location: MyView.swift - Purpose: Button to submit form */
/* AI-translated - please verify with native speakers. */
"myFeature.submitButton" = "Absenden";
```

### Pluralization

Use `.stringsdict` files for strings that change based on quantity.

#### Simple Languages (English, German, Dutch, Spanish, French)

These languages use two forms: `one` (exactly 1) and `other` (0, 2+).

```xml
<key>items.count</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSStringLocalizedFormatKey</key>
    <string>%#@count@</string>
    <key>count</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSStringFormatSpecTypeKey</key>
        <string>NSStringPluralRuleType</string>
        <key>NSStringFormatValueTypeKey</key>
        <string>d</string>
        <key>one</key>
        <string>%d item</string>
        <key>other</key>
        <string>%d items</string>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

#### Slavic Languages (Polish, Russian, Ukrainian)

These languages have complex plural rules with four forms:

| Form  | Polish Example    | Numbers             |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| one   | 1 wiadomosc       | 1                   |
| few   | 2-4 wiadomosci    | 2-4, 22-24, 32-34… |
| many  | 5-21 wiadomosci   | 0, 5-21, 25-31…    |
| other | 1.5 wiadomosci    | Fractions           |

Example for Russian:
```xml
<key>one</key>
<string>%d сообщение</string>
<key>few</key>
<string>%d сообщения</string>
<key>many</key>
<string>%d сообщений</string>
<key>other</key>
<string>%d сообщений</string>
```

### Testing Translations

1. Build the app
2. Change the simulator/device language in Settings
3. Launch PocketMesh and verify strings appear correctly

For German translations, test at the largest Dynamic Type size since German words are often longer than English.
